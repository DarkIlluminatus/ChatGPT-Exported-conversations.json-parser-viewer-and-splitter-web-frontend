# ChatGPT Exported Conversations Viewer

A blazing-fast, zero-dependency web frontend for parsing and exploring ChatGPT's `conversations.json` export files. Built with Websim, this tool transforms OpenAI's massive, single-line ChatGPT exported conversation.json blobs into clean, collapsible, downloadable conversation threads.

## Fully Functional demonstration via Github Pages:
